\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

This chapter provides an introduction to the research topic, establishes the context, and outlines the objectives and contributions of this thesis.

\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:intro-background}

The field of study has seen significant developments in recent years, driven by advances in technology and growing interest from both academia and industry. Understanding these developments requires a solid foundation in the underlying principles and their practical applications.

This thesis addresses the challenge of improving existing methods through a novel approach. The motivation stems from observations that current techniques, while effective in many scenarios, exhibit limitations when applied to complex real-world problems \cite{miller2023advances}.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro-problem}

Despite considerable progress, several challenges remain unaddressed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Existing methods often require substantial computational resources
    \item Current approaches may not generalize well to new domains
    \item There is a need for more interpretable and transparent solutions
\end{enumerate}

These challenges motivate the research presented in this thesis, which aims to develop improved methods that address these limitations while maintaining high performance.

\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:intro-objectives}

The primary objectives of this research are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To investigate the limitations of current approaches
    \item To develop a novel method that addresses identified shortcomings
    \item To validate the proposed approach through comprehensive experiments
    \item To demonstrate practical applicability in relevant domains
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions}
